# Wikipedia Dart

This monorepo contains:

* shared - A Dart client API that wraps a limited part of the Wikipedia API.
* flutter_app - A Flutter app that displays articles and timelines from Wikipedia.
* command_line_client - A command line app that fetches articles and timelines from Wikipedia and displays them to the user.
* [TODO] Wikipedia HTML - A Dart web app that doesn't use Flutter.


The lint rules are quite pedantic
